## SDL
Header-only C++23 wrapper for SDL 2.30.

### Building the tests
- Run `bootstrap.[bat|sh]`. This will install doctest + sdl, and create the project under the `./build` directory.
- Run cmake on the `./build` directory and toggle `SDL_BUILD_TESTS`.
- Configure, generate, make.

### Using
The cmake project exports the `sdl::sdl` target, hence you can:
```cmake
find_package         (sdl CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries([YOUR_PROJECT_NAME] PRIVATE sdl::sdl)
```
And then point the `sdl_DIR` to the build or installation directory.
Alternatively, you can copy the contents of the include folder to your project.

### Design notes
- Functions:
  - The order of parameters are identical to the SDL with the following exception: 
    - Parameters with default values are moved to the end of the function, and are ordered from the most to least likely to be changed.
- Error Handling:
  - This library does not throw exceptions, except for the exceptions thrown due to standard library usage.
  - Errors are propagated to the caller using `std::expected<T, std::string>`, the unexpected state containing the result of `sdl::error()`.
  - Error handling is performed if the documentation of the native function specifies an error state.
- Versioning:
  - The major, minor and patch version are identical to the supported version of SDL.

### Future work
- Evaluate each use of `std::expected<type, std::string>` and determine if it should be replaced with a `type` with invalid content.
- Consider a detail namespace or separate namespaces for headers to reduce and organize the information presented by intellisense.
- Examples and higher-level abstractions:
  - In particular, a micro application engine consisting of the following abstractions, gathering the content of SDL into several `system` monoliths:
    - `engine`
    - `system`
      - `audio_system`
      - `display_system`
      - `input_system`
      - `rendering_system` 
      - `time_system`
- Tests.
